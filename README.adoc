[[JobcopyBuilderplugin-Howdoesthiswork?]]
== How does this work?

This plugin works as following:

. Reads the configuration xml (config.xml) of the copying job.
. Applies the operations to the configuration xml string.
. Create a new job with the processed configuration xml string.

[[JobcopyBuilderplugin-Extensionpoint]]
== Extension point

A new way to provide choices can be added with implementing
`+JobcopyOperation+`, overriding the following method:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public String perform(String xmlString, String encoding, EnvVars env, PrintStream logger);
----

or, with extending `+AbstractXmlJobcopyOperation+`, overriding the
following method:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
abstract public Document perform(Document doc, EnvVars env, PrintStream logger);
----
